  "lyrics": "<p>I've used hammers made out of wood<br>I have played games with pieces and rules..<br>I've deciphered tricks at the bar...<br>But now you're gone,... I haven't figured out why...<br>I've come up with riddles... and jokes about war...<br>I've figured out numbers and what they're for...<br>I've understood feelings..  and I've understood words...<br>But how could you be taken away?...<br><br>And wherever you've gone...and wherever we might go...<br>It don't seem fair...today just disappeared...<br>Your light's reflected now,... reflected from afar...<br>We were but stones,... your light made us stars<br><br>With heavy breath,... awakened regrets...<br>Back pages and days alone that could have been spent, <br>Together... but we were... miles apar...t<br>Every inch between us becomes light years now...<br>No need to be void,... or save up on life...<br>You got to spend it all.....<br><br>And wherever you've gone... and wherever we might go...<br>It don't seem fair...you seemed to like it here...<br>Your light's reflected now,... reflected from afar<br>We were but stones,... your light made us stars<br><br>And wherever you've gone... and wherever we might go...<br>It don't seem fair...today just disappeared...<br>Your light's reflected now,... reflected from afar...<br>We were but stones,... your light made us stars<br></p>"
